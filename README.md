catreact-tutorial
===============

**This module is the Catavolt React Tutorial**

# To begin the tutorial

* clone this repo **git clone https://github.com/catavolt-oss/catreact-tutorial.git**

# Get setup for building the code

* Install Typescript (or an ide with Typescript support).  [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is recommended as an ide, as it has very good Typescript support

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (5+ recommended) directly or use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to easily manage installations

* From this project's root directory (catreact-tutorial), run **'npm install'**. This should install all required packages to the 'node_modules' directory in 'catreact-tutorial', including the catavolt library dependencies.


# Configuring WebStorm for Typescript:

* Open the catreact-client project root folder in WebStorm
* Go to WebStorm -> Preferences -> Languages and Frameworks -> Javascript
* Set the Language Level to React JSX
* Go to WebStorm -> Preferences -> Languages and Frameworks -> TypeScript panel
* Make sure the path to the Node interpreter is correct
* Choose 'Enable TypeScript Compiler'
* Choose 'Use tsconfig.json' radio option
* Click 'Apply' and 'Ok'
* Open the TypeScript Compiler panel at the bottom of WebStorm and Choose 'Compile All' from the buttons on the left


# To build the web bundle in catavolt-client

* From the root directory run 'npm start'

* This will run babel (ES6 transpiler) and a 'web formatter' on the javascript generated by your typescript files. This will generate a single 'bundle' file that can be included on webpages.  To see an example of this check the 'npm start' script in the package.json file.  This script uses 'watchify' with a babel plugin to acheive both transformations.

# To run the client

* Open the index.html in the 'web' directory (or 'launch' it from your ide)
